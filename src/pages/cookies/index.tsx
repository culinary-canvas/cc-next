          <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved
            on your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a
            browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences,
            either for a single visit (through a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or
            for multiple repeat visits (using a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).
          </p>
          <p>
            Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the
            course of your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close
            the web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our
            Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you
            close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a
            consistent and efficient experience for you while visiting the
            Website and Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies may be set by the Website (&quot;first-party cookies&quot;),
            or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide
            advertising or analytics services on the Website (&quot;third party
            cookies&quot;). These third parties can recognize you when you visit
            our website and also when you visit certain other websites.
          </p>
          <h2>What type of cookies do we use?</h2>
          <h3>Analytical cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies enable us and third party services to collect
            aggregated data for statistical purposes on how our visitors use the

            Third party cookies from social media sites (such as Facebook,
            Twitter, etc) let us track social network users when they visit or
            use the Website and Services, or share content, by using a tagging
            mechanism provided by those social networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            These cookies are also used for event tracking and remarketing
            purposes. Any data collected with these tags will be used in

          <h2>Do we use web beacons or tracking pixels?</h2>
          <p>
            Our emails may contain a &quot;web beacon&quot; (or &quot;tracking
            pixel&quot;) to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any
            clicks through to links or advertisements within the email.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use this information for purposes including determining which
            of our emails are more interesting to users and to query whether
            users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not
            wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should read the
            email in plain text view or with images disabled.
